It seems there might be a confusion in your question. Tabulea is not a known data analysis tool or platform. It's possible you meant to refer to Tableau, which is a popular data visualization and business intelligence tool. I will provide a solution based on the assumption that you are referring to Tableau.

Here's how a healthcare provider can use Tableau to develop a predictive model for identifying patients at high risk for readmission:

1. **Data Import and Preparation:**
   - Import the patient data into Tableau from their data sources, ensuring that all relevant information, including patient demographics, medical history, hospital stay details, and readmission status, is included.
   - Clean and preprocess the data, addressing any outliers or missing values. Transform and normalize the data as necessary for analysis.

2. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - Use Tableau's data visualization tools to explore the data and identify patterns or trends related to patient readmission.
   - Create visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and readmission risk.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Utilize Tableau's predictive modeling capabilities, which include integration with statistical and machine learning models.
   - Choose an appropriate predictive model, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests, and build the model using historical data. Train and validate the model to ensure its accuracy.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the predictive model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Adjust the model parameters if necessary to improve its predictive power.

5. **Real-time Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Set up interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau to monitor patient data in real-time.
   - Integrate the predictive model into the dashboard to generate risk scores for patients based on their data, allowing healthcare providers to identify high-risk patients as soon as they are admitted.

6. **Implementation and Intervention:**
   - Once high-risk patients are identified, healthcare providers can take proactive measures to prevent readmission. This might include personalized care plans, additional monitoring, or follow-up appointments.

7. **Iterative Improvement:**
   - Continuously collect and analyze new patient data to refine and improve the predictive model's accuracy.
   - Adapt strategies and interventions based on the model's predictions and real-world outcomes.

Using Tableau for predictive modeling and real-time monitoring can help healthcare providers improve patient outcomes by identifying at-risk individuals early in their care journey, ultimately reducing readmission rates and associated costs.
